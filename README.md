# ðŸŽ“ Student Grade Management System â€“ Python CLI Project

This is a simple command-line application I created using Python to manage student grades using a dictionary. The program allows users to add, update, delete, and view student records through a menu-driven interface.

- Add a new student and their grade  
- Update an existing student's grade  
- Delete a student from the dictionary

- Exit the program

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to use Python dictionaries to store and access key-value pairs  
- Writing and organizing functions (add_student(), update_student(), delete_student(), display_all_students())  
- Using if-elif-else for menu control  
- Getting user input with input() and converting types with int()  
- Structuring a basic loop-based program using while True
